Hello, Future Andrew!

I'm old version of you! Remember when we were 3rd year Highschool when the HTML and Visual Basic introduced to us? We were fell in love how programming works (ofcourse we were too young to understand that HTML is not really a programming) and thinking this will be our future job. However, as we progress every year till college graduation, we eventually give up about programming and focused on what we will get in the future. But hey! We are starting over again! I know you will continue this path until we became so good at it! Goodluck!

On this topic, I'm creating a recipe (ofcourse from the Internet!) using HTML Basics, from fonts, lists, links, and images!

To add to that, we are now using Linux, vscode, Git and Github! All thanks to Odin Project!
